# twitter-bitcoin-bot
A bot that periodically tweets out the value of Bitcoin in AUD or USD depending how you tweak the output

All you would need to run this project would be your own authorised twitter bot and associated keys filled into the .py file and as long as the script is running, your put will tweet the price every 5 minutes
